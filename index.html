                <p><img src="./assets/headshot.png" class="img-thumbnail mr-3">Hey there! My name is Cooper Seibert, and I am an aspiring web developer. I have used computers my entire life, and while most of that time was spent gaming or using social media, I have always had an interest in what makes these programs "tick". My interest was not truely piqued until I was involved in the rollout of a payment processing software at my most recent job. As with most new software programs, there were quite a few bugs and issues during the initial rollout period, and while my job was mostly to just assist customers and report bugs as I found them, I couldn't help but wonder what <i>exactly</i> was causing these errors. I started to find myself using the Chrome dev tools to take a look at the web-app side of things, and although most of it was gibberish at the time, I started to pick up on little parts of it. I decided to take my interest one step further and sign up for a Codecademy Pro account, which I ended up enjoying thoroughly and eventually led to me enrolling in the University of Arizona's Full-Stack Developement program.</p><br>
                <p>I am enjoying the program immensely and cannot wait to take what I've learned and apply it in a "real life" setting, whether it be through a new career, or just helping a friend with their personal websites! You can view some of my work by checking out my GitHub profile below, or by clicking the "Portfolio" section above. Thank you for reading this far! :)</p><br>
