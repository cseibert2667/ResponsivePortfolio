# ResponsivePortfolio
Description: 
An example of a responsive layout for a site that could be used as a portfolio. Images are all placeholders and text is filler. Each page features slightly different responsive layouts. 
Bootstrap is used for a majority of the page, though the way they have their containers respond to screen size did not quite seem to match the examples we were given for this assignment, so I did indicate my own media inquiries (I may have overthought this part of it).
